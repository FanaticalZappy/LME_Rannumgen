This is a random number generator which utilises the logistics map equation.

The logistic map equation shows how a population changes depending on a few values: growth-rate (r), population capacity (x), starvation (1 - x).
When the growth rate goes beyond 3.56995, chaos ensues.
This equation was one of the first methods of generating random numbers on computers.
